    "# The Machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "When most people hear \"Machine learning\" they picture a robot: a dependable butler or a deadly Terminator depending on who you ask. But _Machine Learning_ is not just a futuristic fantasy. In fact, it has been around for decades in some specialized applications, such as _Optical Character Recognition (OCR)_. The first ML application that really become main stream took over the world back in the 1990s: it was the _spam filter_. It was followed by hundreds of ML applications that now quietly poweer hundreds of products and features that you use regularly, from better recommendations to voice search.\n",

    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is the science (and art) of _programming computers_ so they can _learn from data_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learns without being explicity programmed. --Arthur Samuel, 1959--\n",
    "    \n",
    "> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. --Tom Mitchell, 1997--\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples that the system uses to learn are called the _training set_. Each training example is called a _training instance_ (or sample). In the case of **spam filter**, the task $T$ is to flag spam from nwe emails, the experience $E$ is the _training data_, and the performance measure $P$ neeeds to be defined; for example, the ratio of correctly classified emails."
